# VIM

## The vim way

* Dot formula: one keystroke to move, on keystroke to execute

## Overview

* Start vim without loading the vimrc
```
vim -u NONE -N
```
* Start with minimal built-in vim plugings
```
# vim file to source vim/essential.vim
set nocompatible
filetype plugin on

# Source with
vim -u vim/essential.vim
```

### Normal Mode

* Jump to last edited position: `g;`

### Insert Mode

* `<C-h>` Delete back one character
* `<C-w>` Delete back one word
* `<C-u>` Delete back to start of the line

### Insert Normal mode

One needs to run a normal command when in insert mode and get back to insert mode right after.
When in insert mode, type `<C-o>`.

* Center buffer when in insert mode: `<C-o>zz`
* Yank a pasted word from insert mode: `<C-r>0`

### Yank

* Previous yanked words are rotated into registered `0-9`
```
# Paste last yanked thing
Normal mode: 0p
Insert Mode: <C-r>0
```

### Substitutions

* When searching, `\n` is a newline
* When replacing, `\r` is a newline

* Perform substitution
```
:s/target/replacement
```
* Repeat
```
&
```
* Reverse
```
u
```
* Confirm a substitution
```
:s/target/replacement/gc
```

### `<C-r>` Mechanism

#### Normal Mode

Redo

#### Insert or Command mode

One can continue with a numbered or named registered:

* `a - z` the named registers
* `"` the unnamed register, containing the text of the last delete or yank
* `%` the current file name
* `#` the alternate file name
* `*` the clipboard contents (X11: primary selection)
* `+` the clipboard contents
* `/` the last search pattern
* `:` the last command-line
* `.` the last inserted text
* `-` the last small (less than a line) delete
* `=5*5` insert 25 into text (mini-calculator)

To list registers: `:reg` or `:registers` or `:di`


## Fugitive: GDiff

### Resources

* [VimCast](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/fugitive-vim-resolving-merge-conflicts-with-vimdiff/)

### Conventions and Naming

* Target (HEAD): `//2` -> Left side
* Merge: `//3` -> Right side
* Working copy: middle

### Commands

* Vertical split 3 way merge `:Gvdiff`
* Horizontal split 3 way merge `:Gsdiff`
* **Changeset Navigation**
  * `]c`: next changeset
  * `[c`: previous changeset
* Select from target: On working copy run `:diffget //2`
* Select from merge: On working copy run `:diffget //3`
* Put from target to working copy: `diffput $working-copy-identifier`
* Chain commands: `diffput demo | diffupdate`
* Mark the patch complete: `diffupdate`
* When all conflicts have been resolved, close all but working copy with `:only`
* Stage the working copy with `:Gwrite`
* Keep Target / Merge entirely and adds it to the index: `Gwrite!` - Warning: It will lose the working copy

### Python integration

Neovim needs the `neovim` and `pynvm` packages available to function properly.
Here is how to configure an environment and make it available to neovim:
1. Create a conda environment
```
$ conda create -n pynvim python=3.7
```
2. Install the dependencies
```
$ conda activate pynvim
$ conda install pynvim neovim
```
3. Set the `python3_host_prog` neovim variable to the env path:
```
$ which python
let g:python3_host_prog='RESULT_OF_PREVIOUS_COMMAND'
```
